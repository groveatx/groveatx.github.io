 - **[March 16, 2014][20140316]**

 - **[March 9, 2014][20140309]**

 - **[March 2, 2014][20140302]** - This week we continued our discussion by
   discussing our motivations for evangelism.

 - **[February 16, 2014][20140216]** - God chose a specific delivery method to
   take His Gospel to the ends of the earth. This message connects the dots
   between following Jesus and fishing for people.

 - **[February 9, 2014][20140209]** - Jesus definitively calls us to share the
   Gospel, so we discuss what exactly the Gospel is and what the Grove believes
   about it.

 - **[February 2, 2014][20140202]** - Church in our society doesn't spend a lot
   of time talking about spiritual warfare, but Jesus spoke clearly about a
   world beyond the physical. We look at a story in [Luke 8][luke8:26-39] where
   Jesus confronts a demon, and its implications to our lives here and now.

 - **[January 26, 2014][20140126]** - Everyone, regardless of where they are in
   life, has problems they need to deal with. This message looks at an instance
   where Jesus' disciples reached out to him with a problem, and discusses what
   we can learn from his response.

 - **[January 19, 2014][20140119]** - In [Luke 8][luke8:4-18] Jesus tells a
   parable about sowing seeds. We discuss its implications on how we are to
   listen to God.

 - **[January 12, 2014][20140112]** - Jesus came to save sinners, and we need
   him. This week we saw in [Luke 7][luke7:36] a couple of illusions that keep
   us from understanding and believing that he can save us.

 - **[January 5, 2014][20140105]** - There are many things we can resolve to do
   in 2014, but what if we resolve to find our identity in Jesus? This message
   talks about what [Romans 12][] has to say about our identity, our worship,
   and the fruit of our lives.

 - **[December 15, 2013][20131215]** - Jesus chose to come in the midst of the
   chaos, bringing good news of great joy, and breaking the 400-year silence
   between God and his people. This weeks message reminded us of the incredible
   story of his birth.

 - **[December 1, 2013][20131201]** - It is difficult to remain thankful for
   the things that we have. True, long-lasting thankfulness comes from focusing
   on everything God has done for us.

 - **[November 24, 2013][20131124]** - In [Luke 17][luke17_11] Jesus heals ten
   people of a disease, and only one of them returns to thank him. If we had
   received that blessing, how would we have responded?

 - **[November 17, 2013][20131117]** - While the previous message discusses our
   values and where we're currently at as a community, this message talks about
   where we're going and our game plan for reaching the city.

 - **[November 10, 2013][20131110]** - We discuss who we are and what [our
   values][values] mean for our community.

 - **[November 3, 2013][20131103]** - Who was Jesus? Sometimes we have doubts
   about Him, and in this week's message on [Luke 7][luke7_18] we see that
   we're not alone.

 - **[October 27, 2013][20131027]** - The Bible only records two places where
   Jesus was amazed. Do you know what they are? We talk about them and why
   they're significant in this message on [Luke 7][].

 - **[October 20, 2013][20131020]** - We spent more time covering Jesus's words
   on judgement in [Luke 6][].

 - **[October 13, 2013][20131013]** - We talked about what Jesus has to say
   about judgement in [Luke 6][].

 - **[October 6, 2013][20131006]** - Jesus told us to love our enemies in [Luke
   6][]. In this message we unpack the implications of this difficult passage.
