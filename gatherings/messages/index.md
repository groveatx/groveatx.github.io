 - **[December 15, 2013][20131215]** - Jesus chose to come in the midst of the
   chaos, bringing good news of great joy, and breaking the 400-year silence
   between God and his people. This weeks message reminded us of the incredible
   story of his birth.

 - **[December 1, 2013][20131201]** - It is difficult to remain thankful for
   the things that we have. True, long-lasting thankfulness comes from focusing
   on everything God has done for us.

 - **[November 24, 2013][20131124]** - In [Luke 17][luke17_11] Jesus heals ten
   people of a disease, and only one of them returns to thank him. If we had
   received that blessing, how would we have responded?

 - **[November 17, 2013][20131117]** - While the previous message discusses our
   values and where we're currently at as a community, this message talks about
   where we're going and our game plan for reaching the city.

 - **[November 10, 2013][20131110]** - We discuss who we are and what [our
   values][values] mean for our community.

 - **[November 3, 2013][20131103]** - Who was Jesus? Sometimes we have doubts
   about Him, and in this week's message on [Luke 7][luke7_18] we see that
   we're not alone.

 - **[October 27, 2013][20131027]** - The Bible only records two places where
   Jesus was amazed. Do you know what they are? We talk about them and why
   they're significant in this message on [Luke 7][].

 - **[October 20, 2013][20131020]** - We spent more time covering Jesus's words
   on judgement in [Luke 6][].

 - **[October 13, 2013][20131013]** - We talked about what Jesus has to say
   about judgement in [Luke 6][].

 - **[October 6, 2013][20131006]** - Jesus told us to love our enemies in [Luke
   6][]. In this message we unpack the implications of this difficult passage.
