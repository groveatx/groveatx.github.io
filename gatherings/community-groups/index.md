  Community groups are the heart and soul of The Grove. This is where we forge
  real friendships that last. These are the places we share our hopes, goals,
  passions, and lives with others. These groups become the foundation for
  sharing Jesus's love with the rest of the world.

## Community Groups

CG’s are simply a group of friends, real friends, some would even say family, who are pursing Christ together.  Real friends just don’t fit friends into an hour-a-week meeting. Instead, they do life together – learn, laugh, pray, eat, serve, labor and celebrate – living out the Gospel in real tangible ways. This IS the church. It’s through our CG’s that we serve the city – each group is empowered to identify an opportunity to love and serve others.  That’s how we got involved with the homeless, and refugees, and fighting human trafficking and a lot of other ways.  It takes time to build real relationships and God never intended for you to go alone.  Check out one of our CG’s.  Email the contact and don’t worry…there’s no expecation for you to commit your life away.
