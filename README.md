## the grove church website.

it's deployed to github pages because it's free, fast, and secure. that means
anyone in the @groveatx github org can deploy. the domain is registerd to
@aaronj1335's [dnsimple][] account, and the dns hosting happens there as well.

### adding a post

 - go [here][posts], click the 'Create a new file here' button:

![create a new file](http://i.imgur.com/KUgzcd0.png)

 - name the file similarly to the other files, the date followed by the post
   title, so if you're doing the announcements for june 23rd, you'd title it
   `2013-06-23-announcements.md`.
 - add the necessary metadata about what your post to the top of the file (it's
   important to use this exact format, but use your own info, of course):

```yaml
---
title: Announcements for June 13, 2013
date: 2013-06-23
author: Aaron Stacy
layout: post
---
```

 - and then write your post in the [markdown][] format. it'll probably look
   something like this:

```markdown

# this is your post title, it starts with the "#" character

this is some intro paragraph. note that there is a blank line before and after
the paragraph. that's important.

 - this
 - is
 - a
 - bulleted list
 
## sub-headings start with two pound signs

> this is a quote, it starts the line with a "greater than" sign

and you can also do **bold** and *italics* by surrounding the word with asterisks.
```

 - then click the 'Commit New File' button at the bottom

 - make sure to visit [the news page](http://groveatx.org/news/) to see your new post.

### developing

start up a server:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:groveatx/groveatx.github.io.git
$ cd groveatx.github.io
$ jekyll server --watch
```

and [open it in your browser](http://localhost:4000).

note that `css/style.css` is generated by the jekyll build, so if you want to
edit styles you gotta have jekyll and lessc in your `$PATH`.

### deplying

just push to the github repo to deploy to the github page, or put the `_site`
directory on a server somewhere.
