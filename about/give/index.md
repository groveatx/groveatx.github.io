## Give

There are opportunities to give to good causes everywhere.  In fact, you might think The Grove  is just another one of them. To us, one thing is different. Our giving isn’t about a cause or for charity.  It’s about worship.

God instructs us, through the Bible, to give regularly, generously and sacrificially out of all that He gives us—all as part of our worship of Him. What an appropriate response to who He is and all He has done…an expression of gratitude, obedience, and reverence: worship.

What we do with what we have directs our heart. Giving to God reminds us that He has given us everything we have, and can be counted on to meet every need we will ever have. And The Church is His plan, through Jesus, to reconcile the world to himself. To bring healing through relationships, to support one another and encourage one another. So we give, to advance the gospel through His ministry.

## How To Give To The Grove

If you are part of The Grove church family, there are a few ways that you can give. Each week, there is an opportunity, in the midst of our worship and Celebration Gathering, to give.  You can place your offering in one of the boxes at the back of the room.  You can also give your offering online.
