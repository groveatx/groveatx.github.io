## The Grove Grillout

Every month the grove goes downtown and makes burgers for anyone that's hungry
because we believe that Jesus calls us to serve others with no strings
attached.

- When: 1<sup>st</sup> Sunday of each month. Our next
  grillout is **Sunday, August 3<sup>rd</sup>**.
- Where: [7th and Neches][where]
- What: Show up and find parking either in the back of the lot or on the street
  nearby. We'll put you to work on something such as grilling or passing out
  food. Kids are welcome, though it is important to keep a close watch on them.

### Donations

The grillout is made possible through generous donations. If you'd like to
donate, you can contact Casey.
