# Announcements for December 15, 2013

 - **Open House** - Next Sunday evening, December 22<sup>nd</sup> we will be
   getting together for an open house at the Stacy's at 5 P.M. ([4515 Highland
   Terrace][stacys]). This will be a great chance to get to know each other
   outside of just community groups and Sunday mornings. There will be light
   snacks, and kids are welcome!

 - **<em>Season of Giving</em> Board** - [Zilker Elementary is partnering with
   us][zilker] to help families in the community that are in need of extra
   assistance during the winter months. The *Season of Giving* bulletin board
   is located to the right of the main office. Here's how it works:

   - If you would like to participate, take a star off of the bulletin board.

   - Each star represents one wish list item, which is a gift for someone.  The
     star will have the family number, age, gender, and item. If you would like
     to purchase 2 gifts for a child, take 2 stars.  Three gifts? Take 3
     stars&hellip; etc.

   - Once you take the star(s) off the board, write your name on the clipboard
     next to the corresponding star number(s).

   - Then, buy and wrap the purchased item(s) and secure the star on the item
     so we will know who will be receiving the gift.

   - Bring the wrapped gifts to Mrs. Vreeland’s room by Monday, December
     16<sup>th</sup>.  If you have any questions or if you would like a star to
     be sent home with the child because you can’t make it to Zilker, please do
     not hesitate to contact [Oscar][].
