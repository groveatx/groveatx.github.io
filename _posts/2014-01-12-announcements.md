# Announcements for January 12, 2014

 - The [ladie's community group][ladies] will be meeting this Wednesday
   at 8:15 P.M. Watch the Facebook page for the location or [contact
   Jayme][jayme].

 - Please pray for our friends and ministry partners in South Sudan. The
   fighting has reached a point where they have been forced to flee to Uganda.
   Pray for peace and safety, and that the violence will not hinder their work
   in spreading the Gospel.
