# Announcements for December 22, 2013

 - **Open House** - This evening we will be getting together for an open house
   at the Stacy's at 3 P.M. ([4515 Highland Terrace][stacys]). This will be a
   great chance to get to know each other outside of just community groups and
   Sunday mornings. There will be light snacks and drinks, and kids are
   welcome! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact Aaron at
   812-764-8208.

 - **No gathering next Sunday morning** - We will not be meeting next Sunday,
   December 29<sup>th</sup> in order to give the folks that volunteer every
   week a chance to relax and enjoy friends and family. Thank you all so much
   for your dedication!
