# Announcements for November 24, 2013

 - **<em>Season of Giving</em> Board** - [Zilker Elementary is partnering with
   us][zilker] to help families in the community that are in need of extra
   assistance during the winter months. The <em>Season of Giving</em> bulletin
   board is located to the right of the main office, beginning this past
   Friday, November 22<sup>nd</sup>. Here's how it works:

   - If you would like to participate, take a star off of the bulletin board.

   - Each star represents one wish list item, which is a gift for someone.  The
     star will have the family number, age, gender, and item. If you would like
     to purchase 2 gifts for a child, take 2 stars.  Three gifts? Take 3
     stars&hellip; etc.

   - Once you take the star(s) off the board, write your name on the clipboard
     next to the corresponding star number(s).

   - Then, buy and wrap the purchased item(s) and secure the star on the item
     so we will know who will be receiving the gift.

   - Bring the wrapped gifts to Mrs. Vreeland’s room by Monday, December
     16<sup>th</sup>.  If you have any questions or if you would like a star to
     be sent home with the child because you can’t make it to Zilker, please do
     not hesitate to contact [Oscar][].

 - **Collecting winter clothes for the homeless** - The first Sunday of every
   month we head downtown and grill burgers for anyone that's hungry. We won't
   be back down there for a couple weeks, but it's getting cold out, so we want
   to collect winter clothes to distribute as well. If you have any, please
   plan on brining them to the grill-out on December 1<sup>st</sup>, or the
   gathering if you that's easier for you. If you have any questions,
   contact [Steven][].

 - **Community groups** - Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, the only community
   group that will be meeting this week is the Curry's. You can find more info
   on the [community group page][cgs].
