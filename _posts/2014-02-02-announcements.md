# Announcements for February 2, 2014

 - **Serving the homeless downtown**: It's the first Sunday of February, so
   we'll be downtown at [7th and Neches][lot] at 2 P.M. to grill burgers and
   pass them out to anyone who is hungry. Keep in mind this is an hour earlier
   than usual to account for the Super Bowl. Come join us!
