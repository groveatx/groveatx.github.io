# Announcements for December 8, 2013

 - **<em>Season of Giving</em> Board** - [Zilker Elementary is partnering with
   us][zilker] to help families in the community that are in need of extra
   assistance during the winter months. The *Season of Giving* bulletin board
   is located to the right of the main office. Here's how it works:

   - If you would like to participate, take a star off of the bulletin board.

   - Each star represents one wish list item, which is a gift for someone.  The
     star will have the family number, age, gender, and item. If you would like
     to purchase 2 gifts for a child, take 2 stars.  Three gifts? Take 3
     stars&hellip; etc.

   - Once you take the star(s) off the board, write your name on the clipboard
     next to the corresponding star number(s).

   - Then, buy and wrap the purchased item(s) and secure the star on the item
     so we will know who will be receiving the gift.

   - Bring the wrapped gifts to Mrs. Vreeland’s room by Monday, December
     16<sup>th</sup>.  If you have any questions or if you would like a star to
     be sent home with the child because you can’t make it to Zilker, please do
     not hesitate to contact [Oscar][].

 - **Austin Christian Business Summit** - This is an event to encourage,
   educate and engage men and women whose God-given assignments and giftedness
   are primarily in the marketplace, the community, or at home. Speakers
   include pastors from churches right here in Austin. The summit will be at
   6:30 P.M. on Tuesday, December 17<sup>th</sup>. More info available at [the
   website][acbs].
