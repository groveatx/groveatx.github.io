# Announcements for June 13, 2013

 - **Discussion about serving just after the gathering today**: As a church we
   want to constantly look at different ways and opportunities to share the
   love of Christ with those in need in our city. We're going to continue to
   serve the homeless community and look at ways to not only serve them a meal
   but invite them to life with Jesus. In the past we've served refugee
   families, single moms and kids in lower income neighborhoods. These are all
   things that I believe we should always look at and seek the Lord in his
   leading on how we can best serve.

   If this resonates with you, join us for this discussion. If you're uncertain
   about all of this, we would still invite you to join us to see if this
   something God is calling you to be a part of.

 - **Community Group at the Curry's on Wednesday at 6:30 PM** - We'll be
   meeting to pray and hang out with eachother.

 - **Montgomery's Community Group on Thursday at 7:30** - Location TBD.
