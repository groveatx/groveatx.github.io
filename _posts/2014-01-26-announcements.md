# Announcements for January 26, 2014

 - **Serving the homeless downtown**: Next Sunday is Groundhog Day (also the
   1<sup>st</sup> Sunday of February, and there might be a big game that day
   too&hellip;), so that means we'll be downtown at [7th and Neches][lot] at 2
   P.M. to grill burgers and pass them out to anyone who is hungry. Note that
   this is an hour earlier than usual to account for the Super Bowl. Come join
   us!
