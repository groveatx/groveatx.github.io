# Announcements for December 1, 2013

 - **Serving the homeless downtown**: It's the first Sunday of December, so
   we'll be downtown at [7<sup>th</sup> and neches][lot] at 3 P.M. to grill
   burgers and pass them out to anyone who is hungry. Additionally, we've been
   collecting winter clothes to distribute, so if you have any to spare, please
   bring them either to either the grill out or the gathering.

 - **<em>Season of Giving</em> Board** - [Zilker Elementary is partnering with
   us][zilker] to help families in the community that are in need of extra
   assistance during the winter months. The *Season of Giving* bulletin board
   is located to the right of the main office. Here's how it works:

   - If you would like to participate, take a star off of the bulletin board.

   - Each star represents one wish list item, which is a gift for someone.  The
     star will have the family number, age, gender, and item. If you would like
     to purchase 2 gifts for a child, take 2 stars.  Three gifts? Take 3
     stars&hellip; etc.

   - Once you take the star(s) off the board, write your name on the clipboard
     next to the corresponding star number(s).

   - Then, buy and wrap the purchased item(s) and secure the star on the item
     so we will know who will be receiving the gift.

   - Bring the wrapped gifts to Mrs. Vreeland’s room by Monday, December
     16<sup>th</sup>.  If you have any questions or if you would like a star to
     be sent home with the child because you can’t make it to Zilker, please do
     not hesitate to contact [Oscar][].

 - **Collecting winter clothes for the homeless** - The first Sunday of every
   month we head downtown and grill burgers for anyone that's hungry. We won't
   be back down there for a couple weeks, but it's getting cold out, so we want
   to collect winter clothes to distribute as well. If you have any, please
   plan on brining them to the grill-out on December 1<sup>st</sup>, or the
   gathering if you that's easier for you. If you have any questions,
   contact [Steven][].
